                <p class="date">Aug 30, 2021</p>
                <p>Mixing Spaceflight And Philanthropy There is no escaping the fact that a flight to space (at least to
                    low-Earth orbit), with prices in the tens of millions of dollars, is for the ultra-wealthy. There is
                    an
                    increasing trend of wealthy individuals mixing their spaceflight dreams with philanthropy. While
                    some of
                    these examples may extend beyond what is traditionally...</p>

                <p>A Look Back Let's start by saying that nothing worthwhile comes easy. We're celebrating the 20th
                    anniversary
                    of Dennis Tito's spaceflight. He made history by becoming the first fare-paying private citizen to
                    launch to
                    space. But the road that he traveled to get there was full of challenges. Cast your mind back 20
                    years
                    ago
                    to April 2001...</p>

                <p>Commercial Spaceflight in 2021 In early 2019 I wrote what is still one of the most popular blogs on
                    Space
                    Adventures' website - Commercial Spaceflight in 2019. I thought it would be interesting to re-visit
                    this
                    topic and look at the status of commercial spaceflight at the start of 2021. As is often the case in
                    the

                <p>I think many of us will be glad to see the end of 2020 and will welcome 2021 with open arms. But
                    before
                    we
                    do, I thought it was worth looking back at some of 2020's significant achievements in the field of
                    space
                    exploration - completed despite the global pandemic - as well as some of our favorite photographs

                <p>A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 2) We are often asked what there is to do on the

                <p>A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 1) A small group of lucky (and very successful) people
                    have
                    launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on flights arranged by Space Adventures. In the
